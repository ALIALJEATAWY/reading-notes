## **How do Computers work** ##

*Computers are changing the world, you can find it every war, all people using computer without know how its work.*

*As humans, we have always built tools to help us solve problems, tools like a wheelbarrow, a hammer, or a printing press, all of this invention helped us with manual work.*

***There is 4 different tasks for all computers:***

* Input: is the stuff that the world does or that you do that makes the computer do stuff.
* Storage: all the different inputs give a computer information, which is then stored in memory. 
* Processing: a computers processor takes information from memory it manipulates it after that back to be stored in memory again.
* Output: computer outputs information depends on what the computer is designed to do.

***Data & binary***
*Inside a computer are electric wires and circuits that carry all the information in a computer.*

#### *Binary: a binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, which uses only two symbols: typically "0" (zero) and "1" (one).* ####

#### *Data: data are a set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables about one or more persons or objects, while a datum (singular of data) is a single value of a single variable.* ####

*Every input or output of a computer is effectively type of information which can be represented by on or off electrical signals*

*A computer uses millions of teeny electronic components, which come together to form circuits*

#### *No matter what it is you want to do with the computer, every single action is about:* ####
*inputting information from the physical world, storing and processing that information, and getting some output back into the physical world.*

*Hardwar: every thing in the computer you can see like a speaker, plugs, and all sorts of other stuff.*

*Software: every thing in the computer you donâ€™t see is the software like a computer programs, or code, running on this machine*

*The CPU is the master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer and, receives simple commands that tell it which circuit to use to do a specific job.*

*Software tells the CPU what to do.*

*The operating system of the computer is the master program that manages how software gets to use the hardware of the computer*
