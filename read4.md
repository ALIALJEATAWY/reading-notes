## **Chapter 18 process and design**

### **process&design**

***Its looks at who might be vesting your site and those visitors need, it can be helpful to ask some questions about the people you would expect to be interested in the subject of your site.***

*Your content and design should be influenced by the goals of your users.
To help determine why people are coming to your website, there are two basic categories of
questions you can ask:*
* The first attempts to discover the underlying motivations for why visitors come to the site.
* The second examines the specific goals of the visitors. 

### *information can help guide your site designs:*
*Look at each of the reasons why people will be visiting your site and determine what they need to achieve their goals.
You can prioritize levels of information from key points down to non-essential or background information.*

#### *Key Information :*
* Will they be familiar with the product / service / information you are covering or do they need background information on it?
* What are the most important features of what you are offering?
* What is special about what you offer that differentiates you from other sites that offer something similar?
* Once people have achieved the goal that sent them to your site, are there common questions people ask about this subject area?

### *A website about fashion trends will need to change a lot more frequently than one that is promoting a service that people do not buy regularly (such as domestic plumbing or double glazing).*
### *Once a site has been built, it can take a lot of time and resources to update it frequently. Working out how often people are likely to revisit your site gives you an indication for how often you should update the site.*

#### **The aim is to create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site. This is known as a site map and it will show how those pages can be grouped.
To help you decide what information should go on each page, you can use a technique called card sorting.**



## **Chapter 17 HTML5**

***HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
The point of creating these new elements is so that webpage authors can use them to help describe the structure of the page.***



### *Elements shared by the websites:*

### *Headers & Footers
**The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.**

### *Navigation <nav>
**The <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.**

### *Articles <article>
**The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.**

### *Article <aside>
**The <aside> element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an <article> element or not.**

### *Sections <section>
**The <section> element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading**

### *Heading Groups <hgroup>
**The purpose of the <hgroup> element is to group together a set of one or more <h1> through <h6> elements so that they are treated as one single heading.**




## **Chapter 8 Extra markup**

***In HTML5, web page authors do not need to close all tags, and new elements and attributes will be introduced. At the time of writing, the HTML5 specification had not been completed, but the major browser makers had started to implement many of the new features, and web page authors were rapidly adopting the new markup.***

*Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page.*

*For example, you might have some paragraphs of text that contain information that is more
important than others and want to distinguish these elements, or you might want to differentiate
between links that point to other pages on your own site and links that point to external sites.*

### *Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as inline elements.
