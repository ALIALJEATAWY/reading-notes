### **process&design**

***Its looks at who might be vesting your site and those visitors need, it can be helpful to ask some questions about the people you would expect to be interested in the subject of your site.***

*Your content and design should be influenced by the goals of your users.
To help determine why people are coming to your website, there are two basic categories of
questions you can ask:*
* The first attempts to discover the underlying motivations for why visitors come to the site.
* The second examines the specific goals of the visitors. 

### *information can help guide your site designs:*
*Look at each of the reasons why people will be visiting your site and determine what they need to achieve their goals.
You can prioritize levels of information from key points down to non-essential or background information.*

#### *Key Information :*
* Will they be familiar with the product / service / information you are covering or do they need background information on it?
* What are the most important features of what you are offering?
* What is special about what you offer that differentiates you from other sites that offer something similar?
* Once people have achieved the goal that sent them to your site, are there common questions people ask about this subject area?

### *A website about fashion trends will need to change a lot more frequently than one that is promoting a service that people do not buy regularly (such as domestic plumbing or double glazing).*
### *Once a site has been built, it can take a lot of time and resources to update it frequently. Working out how often people are likely to revisit your site gives you an indication for how often you should update the site.*
