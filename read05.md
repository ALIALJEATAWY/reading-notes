# ***Css***
***Color***

*The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:*

* *rgb values*
*These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up.*

* *hex codes*
*These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color.*

* *color names*
*There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers.*

* ***You can specify your choice of background color in the same three ways you can specify foreground colors: RGB values, hex codes, and color names (covered on the next page). If you do not specify a background color, then the background is transparent.***

* ***Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue***

* ***Computer monitors are made up of thousand of tiny squares called pixels.***


### *Contrast*

***When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.***


* **Opacity**
*the opacity property which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements.*

* **Hsl color**
*An entirely new and intuitive way to specify colors using hue, saturation, and lightness values.*

* **Hsl & hsla**
*alternative way to specify colors. The value of the property starts with the letters hsl*



* *It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).*


*CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.*
