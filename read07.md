## ***JAVASCRIPT & JQUERY*** ##
#### ***Java script make web pages more interactive with:*** ####
* *Access content:* *You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page*

* *Modify content:* *You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them.*

* *Program rules:* *You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page.*

* *REACT TO EVENTS:* *You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred.*

### ***Script*** ### 
#### ***A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.*** ####

*To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.*

*Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps:*

1: DEFINE THE GOAL
2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT
3: CODE EACH STEP


* *six rules you must always follow when giving a variable a name:*

- *The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number.*

- *The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.*

- *You cannot use keywords or reserved words.*

- *All variables are case sensitive*

- *Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores.*

- *If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter ofevery word after the first word*

### ***ARRAYS*** ###
#### ***An array is a special type of variable. It doesn'tjust store one value; it stores a list of values. *** ####

*Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).*

*An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.*

* *EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE.*

* *EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE*

* *A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.*

* *Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.*
