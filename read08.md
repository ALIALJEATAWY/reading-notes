## ***Evaluating Conditions*** ##

#### ***You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be, the result will be a boolean: true or false.*** ####

### ***Logical operators*** ###

***Comparison operators usually return single values of true or false.***

*Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comarison operator.*

*logical and (&&): This operator tests more than one condition.*

*Logical or (||):This operator tests at least one condition.*

*Logial not (!):This operator takes a single bollean value and inverts it.*

## ***Loops*** ##

***Loops check a condition, if it returnes true, a code bloc will run, then the condition will be checked again and if it still return true, the code block will run again, it repeats untill the condition returns false, there are three common types of loops:***

* *for: if you need to run code a specific number of times.*

* *while: if you do not know how many times the code should run.*

* *do while: the do...while loop is very similar to the while loop, it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once.*
