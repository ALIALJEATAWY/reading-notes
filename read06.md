## ***JavaScript***

*Before diving into the JavaScript language, you need to know how it will fit together with the HTML and CSS in your web pages.*
*Html: This is where the content of the page lives. The HTML gives the page structure and adds semantics.
*CSS: The CSS enhances the HTML page with rules that state how the HTML content is presented (backgrounds, borders, box dimensions, colors, fonts, etc.).
*JavaScript: This is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity. We will aim to keep as much of our JavaScript as possible in separate files.

### ***CREATING A BASIC JAVASCRIPT***

*JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script. This example adds a greeting into an HTML page. The greeting changes depending on the time of day.*

*LINKING TO A JAVASCRIPT FILE FROM AN HTML PAGE
When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML*

#### *How do I write a script for a web page?* #### 
*It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.
*The HTML element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the element can be used to load a CSS file).
*If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created

### ***STATEMENTS*** ###
*A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon.*

### ***Comment*** ###
*You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code.*

*A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables.*

### ***DATA TYPES*** ###
*JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, strings, and true or false values known as Booleans.*
